A cross platform casual game  - Using Python

Context:

I have been asked to write a game that will appeal to children aged around 6-12. The game involves navigating a character around an area collecting items and avoiding hazards.

Game Description:

The game involves navigating a character around an area collecting items and avoiding hazards. Collecting items adds to your score, colliding with hazards uses up lives, each game character only has a limited number. For example, the player could direct a mouse around a house collecting pieces of cheese, but the mouse needs to avoid cats (hazards) which occupy the house. The game should be timed, with player performance based on the score achieved over a certain time. It should also have levels of difficulty with more difficult levels having more hazards, fewer lives or a shorter time. The game should be exciting and fun to play, as well as visually appealing.

Proposal for a 2D Game – “Feeding Fred”

The inspiration for this game project came from watching TV documentaries about ocean pollution and marine debris in National Geographic, Discovery and BBC channels. Rivers ways and ocean are polluted by marine debris. Marine debris is any man-made, solid material that enters waterways directly through littering or indirectly via rivers, streams and storm drains. Marine debris can be simple items such as a discarded soda can, cigarette butt, or plastic bag that ends up in the ocean potentially harming marine life. Nearly 80 percent of marine debris originates from land-based sources. 
          
In order to convey the message of environmental impact due to human pollution, in particular how fish lives are affected in the sea by marine traffic, I set the game theme of saving a fish from debris/junks. Inspired by the blockbuster film Pixar’s “Finding Nemo”, I created a character named “Fred”, a little fish, who lives in the sea which is pretty busy with ocean liners, yachts and boats. From the passing by ships food and junk are thrown into the sea at random. The player is guiding the fish (“Feeding Fred”) by guiding him towards food only. If Fred touches any edible item such as cake, fruits, etc, his health point increases by one. If he touches any non-edible items (hazards) such as forks, knifes, plastics, his health point decreases by one.  If Fred eats more than certain number of junks he dies – hence the player life time/session ends too. 

In order to keep the player motivated, there is a health meter for Fred which goes down automatically if he did not eat food in regular intervals. The game can be set in 3 levels of difficulty – easy, normal and expert mode.  These modes are differentiated by the speed and the amount of food and junk items falling from the ships.  The game can be played for a set duration of time depending on the difficulty level. At the end of each game a heath score is displayed as the indicator of players performance and at the same time a quick view of heath and score shown during the play time as well.
